        <li>What is a URL?</li>
        <p>URL is an abrievation for Uniform Resource Locator.  It is basically the adress of a web page.</p>
        <li>What is DNS?</li>
        <p>DNS is an abrievation for Domain Name System which translates the human readable domain name into an ip address for the system.</p>
        <li>What is a query string?</li>
        <p>A query string is additional data sent to a a web page.</p>
        <li>What are two HTTP verbs and how are they different?</li>
        <p>HTTP verbs are methods in which http uses to request data.  Two examples are push and get.  Get simply retrieves data as is, while push can alter and update data that it is requesting.</p>
        <li>What is an HTTP request?</li>
        <p>An HTTP request is a request from a client to a server to retrieve data.</p>
        <li>What is an HTTP response?</li>
        <p>An HTTP response is the response given after a request is sent to the server from teh client.</p>
        <li>What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen.</li>
        <p>HTTP headers provide additional information about a request or a response.</p>
        <li>What are the processes that happen when you type “http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser?</li>
        <p>The browser runs the http protocol and the dns then turns the site name into an ip address for the system to request data from.  It then passes in the information "some/page.html"
        to give you a more accurate place within the server to load into.
